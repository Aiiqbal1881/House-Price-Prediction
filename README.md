# House Price Prediction

# Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques with **Python** and **XGBoost Regression**. The model leverages various house features such as location, number of rooms, square footage, and other factors to estimate prices accurately.

# Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and normalizes numerical features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts useful features to enhance predictive performance.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes **XGBoost Regressor**, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizes model parameters for improved accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses RMSE, MAE, and R-squared scores for performance evaluation.

# Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (Supervised Learning, Regression Techniques)
- **XGBoost** (Extreme Gradient Boosting for regression)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for analysis and visualization)

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

# Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `house_price_prediction.ipynb` and execute the cells to train and evaluate the model.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training the model should contain relevant features such as:
- House size (sq ft)
- Number of bedrooms & bathrooms
- Location
- Year built
- Other relevant features

You can use publicly available datasets like the **Kaggle House Prices Dataset** or any custom dataset.

# Model Performance
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **R-Squared Score (RÂ²)**
